# Brewery Search

A brewery search project using the [Open Brewery DB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/ "Open Brewery DB") and Axios promise based HTTP client.

## Features

- search for terms to get back a list of cards showing breweries in the U.S.
- sort results
- highlight text you searched for in results

Future features:

- filter by brewery type
- filter by state (though you can just search for state name)
- add address and link to a map

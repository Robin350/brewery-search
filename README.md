# Brewery Search

A brewery search project using the [Open Brewery DB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/ "Open Brewery DB"), Axios promise based HTTP client and Bootstrap.

A work in progress.

## Features

- search for terms to get back a list of cards showing breweries in the U.S.
- sort results A-Z, Z-A
- color coded brewery types
- highlight text you searched for in results
- address and link to a map

### Future features

- filter by brewery type
- filter by state (though you can just search for state name)
- store keyword highlighter in local/session storage

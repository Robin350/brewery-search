# Brewery Search

A brewery search project using the [Open Brewery DB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/ "Open Brewery DB"), Axios promise based HTTP client and Bootstrap.

A work in progress demo can be viewed here: https://tristandenyer.github.io/brewery-search/

## Features

- search for terms to get back a list of cards showing breweries in the U.S.
- sort results A-Z, Z-A, or group by brewery type
- color coded brewery types
- highlight text you searched for in results
- address and link to a map
- storing keyword highlighter state in session storage

### Future features

- filter by brewery type
- filter by state (though you can just search for state name)
